# Data Reconciliation API

## Introduction

**Data Reconciliation API** is a robust and extensible backend engine designed to reconcile multiple versions of data across disparate sources. Built using Python and Django, this project provides a scalable and secure foundation for organizations that need to ensure data consistency, integrity, and accuracy in environments where data may be duplicated, fragmented, or updated independently.

Data reconciliation is a critical process in data management, especially in scenarios where data is collected from various systems, departments, or external partners. Inconsistent or conflicting data can lead to reporting errors, compliance issues, and operational inefficiencies. This backend engine automates the process of identifying, comparing, and merging different versions of data, applying customizable rules and logic to resolve discrepancies.

The project leverages Djangoâ€™s powerful ORM and REST framework to expose a flexible API for integrating with other systems. It is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to add new reconciliation strategies, data sources, and business logic as requirements evolve.

## Features

- **Automated Data Reconciliation:** Identify and resolve differences between multiple data sources or versions.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new reconciliation rules, data models, and integration points.
- **RESTful API:** Expose reconciliation operations and results via a secure, documented API.
- **OpenAPI Documentation:** Interactive API docs powered by drf-spectacular.
- **Database Agnostic:** Supports PostgreSQL by default, but can be configured for other databases.
